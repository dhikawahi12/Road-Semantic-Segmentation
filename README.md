# Road-Semantic-Segmentation
ASO-LC71 - Computer Vision Project Group 1

The project demonstrates a working semantic road segmentation system that operates in real time using camera input. The results confirms that the trained U-Net based model is capable of identifying drivable roads under both daytime and nighttime conditions, which aligns with the original objective of achieving road perception in varying lighting environments.
